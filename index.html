                <p>An organizational vision is the centerpiece and foundation of all corporate strategy, primarily its goals. The
                    vision
                    functions as the “north star” – it points the everyday work of employees as a contribution toward the ultimate
                    long-term
                    accomplishment.</p>

                    challenges that have been facing me, and how I amazingly could overcome the odds. However, everybody in life has
                    will
                    and determination, and we all are given a life to compose it special by achieving our goals.</p>
